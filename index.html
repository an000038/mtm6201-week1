            <li>I come from China, and my hometown is in middle of China which named Xi'an. My birthday is on May 25th. I used to study FE, but I Choose to go back to campus to study IMD. I am a new comer in Canada, and I'm still getting used to living here.

            My hobby is music, and my favourite musician is David Bowie. My favourite line from his song is "Though nothing will keep us together, we can beat them , for ever and ever, we can be us, just for one day." . I also like photography, it makes me be more creative, and I'm so enjoy it.</li>
